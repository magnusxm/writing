On the idea of formal education

I don't know why the idea of security and
comfort are so disconcerting to em. I don't
want the life so many want for me. I
want the life that is far too
	much.
I want to find the edges of the
human condition, and I want to 
write about them exactly one fewer
times that I find them.
I want to learn, but to have no paper
waiting. Why should I have to hold my standard
of learning to their standard of
having learned? I don't want a 
degree for all the reasons that make one
say I should want one.
