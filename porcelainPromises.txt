Porcelain Promises

Each year I am gifted
fine china from friends and family.
On each piece gold lines traces images,
the look like stitches holding it together,

sculpting succinct scenes
of fleetings moments from the Artist's
most intimate day dreams;

Koi in a stream,
Gingko in the fall,
Swallow on her egg,
Sun over the hill.

All staring up at me,
from their scattered pieces covered
in water on their way to the drying rack,

asking me what I know
about glue. About lining up sharp edges
and holding them together. About them
holding water or hot soup.

About putting together the glimmering lines
that shape the sky's end
or the river's beginning--

About seeing what was and finding
what may be again.
